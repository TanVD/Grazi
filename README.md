Grazi is IntelliJ IDEA plugin providing local spell and grammar checking for Markdown, JavaDoc, Plain texts and others.

It uses one of the leading proofreaders &mdash; [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool)
under the hood, so it supports more than 20 languages and  provides best performance and 
accuracy among free (and even non-free) alternatives.

Basically, *Grazi is a Grammarly inside your IDE*.
