/**
33    * This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return
34    * collections.  It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on
35    * collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a
36    * specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.
37    *
38    * <p>The methods of this class all throw a <tt>NullPointerException</tt>
39    * if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.
40    *
41    * <p>The documentation for the polymorphic algorithms contained in this class
42    * generally includes a brief description of the <i>implementation</i>.  Such
43    * descriptions should be regarded as <i>implementation notes</i>, rather than
44    * parts of the <i>specification</i>.  Implementors should feel free to
45    * substitute other algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered
46    * to.  (For example, the algorithm used by <tt>sort</tt> does not have to be
47    * a mergesort, but it does have to be <i>stable</i>.)
48    *
49    * <p>The "destructive" algorithms contained in this class, that is, the
50    * algorithms that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified
51    * to throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the collection does not
52    * support the appropriate. mutation primitive(s), such as the <tt>set</tt>
53    * method.  These algorithms may, but are not required to, throw this
54    * exception if an invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For
55    * example, invoking the <tt>sort</tt> method on an unmodifiable list that is
56    * already sorted may or may not throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.
57    *
58    * <p>This class is a member of the
59    * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
60    * Java Collections Framework</a>.
