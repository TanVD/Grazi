# Here is the good part

It is written completely OK.

It has:
* lists;
* other lists;
* even more lists;

Of course, it has an `inline` fragment.

Even big fragment with injected code.
```kotlin
val a = "So big!"
```

## Now bad part have <warning>go</warning>

It <warning>are</warning> written not <warning>many good</warning> .

Of <warning>course it</warning> has <warning><TYPO>erros</TYPO></warning> in lists:
* so much <warning><TYPO>errorsss</TYPO></warning>!
* even here it is <warning>friend</warning> of error

Once more we have an inline <warning>fragment and</warning> it is `a` friend.

<warning>And</warning> we've got error in injected code!
```kotlin
val b = "It is <warning>friend</warning>"
```
