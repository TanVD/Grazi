# Here is the good part

It is written completely OK.

It has:
* lists;
* other lists;
* even more lists;

Of course, it has an `inline` fragment.

Even big fragment with injected code.
```kotlin
val a = "So big!"
```

## Now bad part have <warning descr="HAVE_PART_AGREEMENT">go</warning>

It <warning descr="IT_VBZ">are</warning> written not <warning descr="MANY_NN_U">many good</warning> .

Of <warning descr="MISSING_COMMA_AFTER_INTRODUCTORY_PHRASE">course it</warning> has <warning descr="MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US">erros</warning> in lists:
* so much <warning descr="MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US">errorsss</warning>!
* even here it is <warning descr="ARTICLE_MISSING">friend</warning> of error

Once more we have an inline <warning descr="COMMA_BEFORE_AND">fragment and</warning> it is `a` friend.

<warning descr="And">And</warning> we've got error in injected code!
```kotlin
val b = "It is <warning descr="ARTICLE_MISSING">friend</warning>"
```
